Example of a Lift 2.4 application served by an embedded Jetty instance, and runnable from a fat jar.

To run locally:
sbt run

To run from a fat jar:
sbt assembly
java -jar target/lift-jetty-fatjar-assembly-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

In either case, the Lift app will then be available at http://localhost:8080.
